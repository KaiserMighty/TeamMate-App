# TeamMate App
## Full-stack project from my senior capstone software engineering class.

The FullDocumentation.pdf file describes out project, what it's meant to achieve, and who it's for. It also shows all of our work and software engineering process throughout the two-week lifecycle of the project. 

If you want to look at the source code or build the application yourself, all source files are included within the application folder. The database design files and .sql files are in the database folder. You'll need to change the credentials inside the backend app > database_queries > databaseConnection.ts to connect the backend to the db. 

If you want to see snapshots frozen in time, of our work as it progressed, look through the pdfs in the Milestones folder.
